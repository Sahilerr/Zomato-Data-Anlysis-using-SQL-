# Zomato-Data-Anlysis-using-SQL-
This project analyzes Zomato-like food delivery data using SQL. The dataset consists of multiple CSV files representing customers, restaurants, orders, delivery details, and riders. After importing the CSVs into a relational database, relationships were created to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and generate business insights.
